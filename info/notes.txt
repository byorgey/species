% The reader is encouraged to download the \pkg{species} library in
% order to play with examples while following along.  It is available on
% Hackage \cite{hackage} and can most easily be installed (along with
% all its dependencies) using the cabal-install tool
% \cite{cabal-install}, provided as part of the Haskell Platform
% \cite{haskell-platform}. Simply typing
% \begin{verbatim}
%     cabal install species
% \end{verbatim}
% at a prompt should download and install the \pkg{species} library
% along with all its dependencies.  \bay{does this work for Windows
%   users too?}  The biggest dependency is the \pkg{numeric-prelude}
% library maintained by Henning Thielemann \cite{numeric-prelude}, which
% provides a mathematically more sane \bay{use a different word?}
% alternative to the standard Haskell Prelude.  In order to play along
% with examples, be sure to start \texttt{ghci} with the
% \texttt{-XNoImplicitPrelude} flag, then unload the \texttt{Prelude}
% module and load the \texttt{MyPrelude} module provided by the
% \pkg{numeric-prelude package}. \bay{provide .ghci file for playing
%   with species library?} \bay{rework this} \bay{mention that it's
%   tested on both GHC 6.10 and 6.12, but requires > 6.8 because of ?
%   type families?}

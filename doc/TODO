* Parser for species expressions

* Move reify/reflect functions to separate module?

* Think about having 'ofSize' take an expression from a small language
  of size constraints, rather than a general Haskell size predicate

* Be sure not to export 'omega' from the Species module

* Improve rec for CycleIndex, right now it has 10 iterations
  hard-coded etc.  Really, I guess this just means improving the
  Newton-Raphson interface and figuring out how to make it lazier.
